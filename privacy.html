            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2><br>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we
                receive and collect when you visit our website, how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard it.
                By using our website, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>1. Information Collection</h3><br>
            <p>We may collect personal information, such as your name, email address, and other contact details when you
                voluntarily provide it, such as by filling out a form or subscribing to our newsletter. Additionally, we
                collect non-personal information, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, and access
                times, to improve our site’s performance and usability.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>2. Use of Information</h3><br>

                Improve, personalize, and expand our website’s services and content.</li>
                Communicate with you, including for customer support and to provide updates.</li>

            <br>
            <h3>3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3><br>
            <p>Our website uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our site and hold
                certain information. Cookies are files with small amounts of data, which may include an anonymous unique
                identifier. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent,
                though some portions of our site may not function properly without them.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3><br>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties unless we
                provide you with advance notice. However, we may share information with trusted third-party service
                providers who assist us in operating our website and conducting our business, so long as those parties

            <h3>5. Data Security</h3><br>
            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Although
                we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, no method of transmission
                over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
